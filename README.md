This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to data frame subsetting.  The `bug.r` file contains code that attempts to select specific columns from a data frame using a character vector of column names.  However, if the character vector includes column names that do not exist in the data frame, it will fail to produce the intended result, leading to unexpected errors or silent dropping of columns. The `bugSolution.r` file provides a corrected version using error handling and more robust subsetting techniques. This example highlights the importance of error checking and careful consideration when working with data frames in R.
